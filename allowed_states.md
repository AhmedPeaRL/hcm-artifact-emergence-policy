## Allowed States of Emergence

An artifact may emerge only under one condition:

The current state can no longer remain
without becoming performative.

This is not urgency.
This is structural saturation.

No metric can confirm this.
No observer can validate it.
No system can detect it automatically.

Only non-action can precede it.
