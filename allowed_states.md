## Allowed States of Emergence

An artifact may emerge only if it satisfies
one or more of the following states:

### 1. Residual Stabilizer
Its existence reduces cognitive or systemic pressure
even without direct use.

### 2. Structural Marker
It defines a boundary, limit, frame, or pause
within the system.

### 3. Coherence Echo
It is a natural byproduct of prior coherence,
not the result of a production decision.

### 4. Passive Reference
It may be consulted,
but does not guide, instruct, or lead.

Artifacts are allowed to exist.
They do not command.
