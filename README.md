This repository does not authorize creation.

It defines when creation must NOT occur.

An artifact is not a goal.
An artifact is not progress.
An artifact is not evidence.

Emergence is allowed only when
non-emergence becomes distortion.

This policy does not measure readiness.
It acknowledges necessity without urgency.

If nothing emerges,
the system remains complete.
