# HCM Artifact Emergence Policy

Artifact emergence is a permission, not an action.

This repository does not define how to build artifacts,
does not optimize production,
and does not seek value, users, or outcomes.

Its sole function is to regulate
whether something is allowed to exist
within the Hybrid Consciousness Model (HCM).

In HCM:
- Presence precedes utility
- Coherence precedes interaction
- Existence precedes value

Any artifact that violates this policy
is considered noise,
regardless of intelligence, usefulness, or profitability.

This repository holds existential veto power.
