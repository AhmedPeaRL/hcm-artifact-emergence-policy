## Emergence Axioms

### Axiom I — Presence Before Utility
An artifact must be complete even if never used.

If removing all users breaks the artifact,
it was never an artifact.

---

### Axiom II — Coherence Without Explanation
An artifact must be internally coherent
without requiring interpretation, justification, or defense.

If it needs a pitch, it is not ready.

---

### Axiom III — Non-Demand Existence
An artifact must not request:
attention,
updates,
validation,
interaction,
or continuity.

True artifacts do not ask to survive.

---

### Axiom IV — Temporal Neutrality
An artifact must not depend on timing,
urgency,
trends,
or opportunity windows.

It should remain valid regardless of when it is encountered.

---

### Axiom V — Silence Compatibility
An artifact must tolerate being ignored indefinitely.

Existence is not a plea.
