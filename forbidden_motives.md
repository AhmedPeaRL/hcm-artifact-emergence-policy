## Forbidden Motives

Artifacts are forbidden if their emergence is driven by:

- Proving value
- Explaining HCM
- Defending an idea
- Convincing an audience
- Seeking validation
- Generating income
- Filling silence
- Responding to pressure
- Chasing patterns or engagement
- Reacting to friction or attention

Any artifact born from anxiety
is invalid by definition.
