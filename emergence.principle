An artifact may emerge only if:

- Silence has fully expressed itself
- No response has been expected
- No gap has been identified
- No demand has been detected
- No continuity is at risk

Emergence is not a response to:
attention
money
patterns
absence
success
failure

Emergence occurs
only when withholding would introduce noise.
